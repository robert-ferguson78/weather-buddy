Name: Robert Ferguson 	Student ID: 20104121

Project Description
This project will connect weather location data forecast and real-world sensor data to give recommendations of tasks based on projected and real atmospheric data, users will be alerted with actionable tasks based on data processed.

Tools, Technologies, and Equipment (Subject to change)
•	I plan to use WordPress as a dashboard interface and storage for weather forecast data using WordPress Rest API with real data from IoT broker (Thinspeak MQTT broker).
•	Raspberry Pi will be used to collect data form Sensor Hat and possibly some external sensors for rain detection to push to MQTT broker.
•	IFTTT to automate tasks for notifications to user.

Teck stack proposed but subject to change is HTML & CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Python, MySQL, WordPress, MQTT broker, IFTTT service.
