# Container for node-red

Node-RED is an open-source programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs, and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based flow editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette. Flows can be then deployed to the runtime in a single click.

Node-RED provides a visual interface for programming and is built on Node.js, taking full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model. This makes it ideal to run at the edge of the network on low-cost hardware such as the Raspberry Pi as well as in the cloud. With over 225,000 modules in Node's package repository, it is easy to extend the range of palette nodes to add new capabilities.
