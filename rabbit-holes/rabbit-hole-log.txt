------------------ Node_red for reading and writing to Mongo Atlas DB Start ----------------

Tried to use Node-Red to take readings from MQTT broker and insert into my Mongo Atlas DB 
which i could do with limited success. Reading from Mongo Atlas DB presented challenges 
as the 2 node packages node-red-contrib-mongodb-aleph and node-red-mongodb would not read
the _id Object for the Mongo Collections which i needed to referenec fro example:
- users collection has the _id Object which i need as it is referenced in stationid Object 
in the Station collection.
- station collection has stationid Object which references the user collection _id Object
- readings collection has the staionid Object that connects it to the station _id Object

So havgin issues readings and settign objects in Mongo Atlas caused issues and to fix i would
need to go over the saved Mongo collections structure which i decided not to do just to adjust 
for a limitation in Node-red packages (both that i tried). Here are some axmaples of flows that
worked but ultimetly coudl not set or read the _id Object

----- Work flow out Node Red to write data to DB ------
- Timestamp input to trigger workflow to Timestamp
- Function to pass in hard coded values (screenshot of this code is commented out as i tried 
differnt approches which were not sucessful)

 msg.payload = {
     timeStamp: "2023-12-11 20:00:00",
     code: 804,
     temperature: 7.41,
     windSpeed: 3.91,
     windDirection: 177,
     pressure: 990,
     stationid: "65723ac8aea4534d4887a555"
 };

 return msg;
 msg.payload = {
         "email": "newuser@example.com"
 };
 return msg;

- Function to take the vlaues from Payload Object and place in another object as my previous
code woudl insert the reasgins as an object inside of collections Object (This function basically stoped
the sub object creation to try match the Mondo Db Document pattern so the webiste coudl take the redaings 
and display to userts)

 msg.payload = {
         "timeStamp": msg.payload.timeStamp,
         "code": msg.payload.code,
         "temperature": msg.payload.temperature,
         "windSpeed": msg.payload.windSpeed,
         "windDirection": msg.payload.windDirection,
         "pressure": msg.payload.pressure,
         "stationid": msg.payload.stationid
 };
 return msg;

- tried both Mongo Db packages which set the collection to write and read from (differnt nodes for in and out)
which did my read data for DB and also write data to DB

----- Work flow in Node Red to read data to DB ------
- Timestamp input to trigger workflow to Timestamp
- Function to pass in hard coded values which is email to find (screenshot of this code is commented out as i tried 
differnt approches which were not sucessful)

msg.payload = {
    "find": "users",
    "query": {
        "document.email":"newuser@example.com",
    }
};
return msg;
